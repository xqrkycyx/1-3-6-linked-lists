## Instructions

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.\
To do so, you will be modifying an existing `LinkedList` class.

### Existing files

| File path           | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| `src/linkedList.js` | Contains the definition of the `LinkedList` class    |

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

1.  In the `src/linkedList.js` file, implement a singly linked list that passes the tests.

_Note: The `insertAtHead` function is a new function that you will need to implement._

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
